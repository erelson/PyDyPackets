Summary
----------------
The scripts in this repo are for reading, storing, parsing, filtering and plotting the byte-packets used for communication by the Dynamixel series of digital servos.

The scripts currently can handle the full instructuion set used for talking `to` Dynamixel servos, and supports the settings for the AX series servos.  MX support is forthcoming.

Usage
-----
There are four scripts with different purposes, and which use each other to an extent:

:``PyDyPackets.py``: Translation, reference data, packet operations
:``PyDyLogger.py``: Monitoring serial port and saving packets to file
:``PyDyParser.py``: Filtering lists of packets by ID, instruction, or command bytes
:``PyDyPlotter.py``: Creating plots from packets; e.g. plots of each servo's position

Each of these scripts can be called from the command line with various options.  For more info, try ``ScriptName.py -h``

The steps for couple envisioned typical use cases are:

(1) Connect computer to a Dynamixel bus, and save bytes using ``PyDyLogger.py``
(2) Feed the output file into ``PyDyParser.py`` with various flags (``-t`` -> human readable output)
(3) Read the filtered output file

or

1) Connect computer to a Dynamixel bus, and save bytes using ``PyDyLogger.py``
2) Feed the output file into ``PyDyPlotter.py`` with various flags and diagnose problems via plots
