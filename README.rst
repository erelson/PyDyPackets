Summary
-------
The scripts in this repo are for reading, storing, parsing, filtering and plotting the byte-packets used for communication by the Dynamixel series of digital servos created by Robotis.

The scripts currently can handle the full instruction set used for talking *to* Dynamixel servos, and supports the settings for various Dynamixel devices.  Currently supported devices are:  

AX-12, AX-12W, AX-18, AX-S1, RX-24, RX-28, RX-64, MX-28, MX-64, MX-106, EX-106

The Scripts
-----------
There are four scripts with different purposes, and which use each other to various extents.
These are divided into two groups; those that the user interacts with, and those that are used internally.

User-friendly:

:``pydysetup``: Sets up a directory for use of the other scripts by creating a default pydypackets.cfg file.
:``pydylogger``: Monitoring serial port and saving packets to file
:``pydyparser``: Filtering lists of packets by ID, instruction, or command bytes
:``pydyplotter``: Creating plots from packets; e.g. plots of each servo's position

Each of these scripts can be called from the command line with various options.
For more info, try ``ScriptName.py -h``

Usage
-----
This software should be installed as a package for Python 2.7.
To do this, download/clone the repository, and then run::

        python setup.py install

The first thing that needs to be done is to create a config file.  To do this you can copy ``Config/config_example.cfg`` to ``Config/pydypackets.cfg``.  The latter is a required name.  An error is given if this file does not exist.

Within the config file, various settings can be found. To start,
set the serial/COM port being used for your setup. Note that the port
specification is OS dependent.  Once you have a config file, you can run stuff!

The steps for a couple of envisioned typical use cases are:

(1) Connect computer to a Dynamixel bus, and save bytes using ``PyDyLogger.py``
(2) Feed the output file into ``PyDyParser.py`` with various flags (``-t`` -> human readable output)
(3) Read the filtered output file in a text editor

Or:

1) Connect computer to a Dynamixel bus, and save bytes using ``PyDyLogger.py``
2) Feed the output file into ``PyDyPlotter.py`` with various flags and diagnose problems via plots

Requirements
----------------
Python (2.7) should be installed.  

Plotting capabilities use MatPlotLib.
